summary: "Guess A card is a simple JavaScript game I built 
during my introductory phase to the JavaScript language. 
I recently rebuilt the game from scratch using better coding 
principles. This article highlights the idea behind the game 
as well as the journey from version 1 to version 2 and what 
I learned along the way."

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Jesse Ajioh and I'm a front end developer for the web.
At the time of writing this article, I've had about one year of experience
programing with Javascript. I build web apps with Javascript frameworks such
as React and Next.js which I deploy to either Netlify or Vercel.

It was during one of such deployments to Netlify that I observed a cool
game that the Netlify dashboard allows you to play while waiting for your site
to be deployed. It is a simple card pairing game. You open a card and
try to guess the corresponding card from from the unopened ones. You do this
until all cards are open. The least amount of guesses it takes to open all
the cards is your high score.

Since I just began learning JavaScript and was eager for new challenges, I decided
to build such a game myself.

## About the game

The current version of Guess A Card game at it's core, features similar
functionality to the Netlify game. A player is tasked with pairing up selected
cards until all cards are opened. The game however offers an extended set of
functionality such as:

### Sneaks

Sneaking is a feature which offers the player an opportunity to briefly observe
the arrangement of all the cards. It is left to the player to memorize this
arrangement within that short time so as to correctly pair up each card and
win the game. A player can only sneak a look at the cards a fixed number of
time for every game round.

### Limited attempts

The game offers only a limited number of attempts after which if all cards are
not open, the game is lost. This deviates significantly from Netlify's version
which gives you unlimited attempts to play.

### Sound effects

Upon building my initial version of the game, I decided to spice things up a bit
by adding sound effects. This makes the game a lot more interesting
and fun to play. The latest version of the game website features a button for toggling sound effects
on or off depending on the players choice. The choice is persisted in local storage
for future visits.

  Because this was my first time working with sound in JavaScript, I naturally
  did some research to figure out how to go about it. It turned out that using
  the Web Audio API for this reason wasn't all that difficult.

## Version 1

It took me a few days to finish my first version of the game. Prior to commencing,
I had failed to sketch out a plan of what I wanted to do and how I intended to do it.
As a result, I had to create game logic on the fly and employ a few gimmicks to get
things to operate the way I wanted. In the end, my code worked, but I'm not proud of
how it was constructed. In fact, when I returned to the project a few months later,
I had a difficult time figuring out my own code.ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜….

In as much as I utilized comments and also tried to extract reusable commands into separate
functions, I ended up with a bunch of nested if-else statements which definitely did not make
the code easier to understand later on.

## Version 2

Rather than attempt to untangle the code in version 1, I opted to create a new
version of the game while retaining the old one for comparison and historical purposes.

For some reason, I expected the new version to have less lines of code,
but the result proved me wrong. Version 1 contained 306 lines of code,
whereas version 2 has 414 lines of code. This is because I used more functions
in version 2 (31 functions) than I used in version 1 (16 functions).
Version 2 also includes more comments that clarify crucial aspects of the game's
functionality. Overall, the second version has a more ordered code structure
that is easier to maintain.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I'd say that this small endeavor taught me a lot. It taught me to be
more organized while writing code, to use clear and easy to understand names for variables and functions,
and to value space and comments in making code easier to read later on. This project may not seem
like much but it's my very first attempt at developing an idea from scratch into a product that actually
meets the requirements for which it was created. I look foward to building more javascript projects
and to documenting every step of the journey.
