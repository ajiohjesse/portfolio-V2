## **JESSE AJIOH - PORTFOLIO**

My name is Jesse Ajioh. I'm a self taught web developer.

I specialize in building full stack web applications with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. My favourite front-end framework is Next.js. I also utilize the MERN stack from time to time.

This is my portfolio website which features a few of the projects I've worked on. You can contact me via ajiohjesse@gmail.com
