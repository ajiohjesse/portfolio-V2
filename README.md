### Hello, I'm Jesse Ajioh. I'm a self taught web developer.

As a web developer with over a year of experience, I am passionate
about creating intuitive and engaging user experiences. I am
proficient in Javascript and have a solid understanding of web
development principles.

In addition to my technical skills, I have copywriting experience
and can bring a unique perspective to any design process. I am
always looking for new ways to improve and grow as a developer,
and I am eager to take on new challenges and projects.

This is my portfolio website which features a few of the projects I've worked on. You can contact me via ajiohjesse@gmail.com
